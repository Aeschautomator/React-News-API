 ## Discussion

 I used the following technologies: HTML, React, and Redux.
I used [create-react-app](https://goo.gl/26jfy4)
to start building this application.
I used [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)
to make establishing a grid system easier, as well as simplify some of the styling.
I used the [HN Search API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) 
to GET articles from Hacker News and display them for the user.
Added bootstrap as well.(https://getbootstrap.com/)

 ## Requirements

Using React and Redux:

- Build an application that lets the user search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (https://hn.algolia.com/api)

- Save the user's search terms in the Redux state (don't need to persist across sessions)
We're looking to see if what you know in React and Redux and querying an API. We're interested in whether you can write clean code and have the ability to learn/understand new technologies. We don't care about design/UI (for this project)
